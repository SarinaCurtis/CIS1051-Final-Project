At first, this project was honestly a pain. I had no idea what I wanted to do, other than knowing I wanted to make some sort of game. I thought I would come up with my final project idea way too late and would have little time to have a decent project, but I am very proud of the work I have completed in this project. A year ago, I would have never thought I'd be making a yahtzee game from code. I think it's so amazing that just a year ago, I was a Math-Econ major, but knew economics was not for me. 

I really enjoyed being able to create something that I thought of on my own. Last year, I did not have a lot of "creative freedom" with my final project, so it was very fun to actually recreate the game me and my family are always playing. Anytime we are all together, someone pulls out the Yahtzee box. 

I can say that I did face many challenges completing this project. I started off this project by writing the functions for each scoring bracket. Some of the functions were easier to write, such as the Chance bracket, which is just the sum of all the current dice values. One scoring bracket function that made me question my coding skills was the small straight function. I just could not figure out a "better" way of writing the small straight function, so I had to just test the list parameter and if any of the small straight possibilities were in the list, then the player would get a possible score for the small straight. Also, at first I was printing the current player's scorecard after each round, but it ended up getting in the way so I commented it out.

Also, I would have loved to do a voiceover for the project video, but apparently my body and pollen do not mix well. (I sure hope it's just allergies). I have been dealing with a sore throat for a minute now, and my voiceover would sound straight out of a horror movie, so I added descriptions beside every picture. 

In the end, I think my project is about 95 percent of my original vision. There are probably some errors that I missed, or some wrong function, but that is perfectly fine. I hope to spend more time with it, without time constraints, and tweak it. From this project, I have learned more about the methods used in python, more about python dictionaries and lists. I have also learned that I am kind of a sloppy coder, and there are better ways to write code.
